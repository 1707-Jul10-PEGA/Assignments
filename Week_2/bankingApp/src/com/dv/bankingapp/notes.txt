$ OBSTACLES

1) Unable to implement Junit

$ TODO

- CURR customer>viewAccount

1) will sql queries happen in each user class?
	dashboard is just calling methods onto the users
	
2) customer > apply
	- having an applicationrequest class might not be needed anymomre..
	
4) setauth user
	- dont need the first sql query?
	
2) createCustomer and employee..
	I inserted new values within the specific tables.
	
	Do i have to do something similar when i load from login?
	Or would the usernames be okay... 
3) employees table seems backwards?
2) Log
 - added one logging to serial classes; where eof is reached
3) Junit

4) final thoughts...
	- can i eventually get rid of the authenticated user?
	- rely solely on database for information
	
DONT FORGET to delete data files for final submission
