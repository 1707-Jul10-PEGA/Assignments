Some obstacles I ran into:
1) Trying to have multiple scanners. I tried having one scanner per method, but closing one would close System.in.
	So I had to reference one scanner
	
2) I wanted to append objects to the text file with serialization but appending objects gave some errors.
	To solve, I have to reference one list with all users
	
3) IOException for reading objects with object input stream.
	It seems that there is no way for readObject to know how many bytes to read. Therefore, I had to catch the IOException to avoid
	reaching the EOF.
	
	
Things to try:
1) Login> create ...
	- Having separate method to write to file
	- It could be that a user object is being written to the file, not the actual implementation?
	
2) Have login.prompt() return an int for the driver
	- if user is verified, proceed to dashboard
	- may have to return a verified int for create ... also
