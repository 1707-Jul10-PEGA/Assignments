Some obstacles I ran into:
1) Trying to have multiple scanners. I tried having one scanner per method, but closing one would close System.in.
	So I had to reference one scanner
	
2) I wanted to append objects to the text file with serialization but appending objects gave some errors.
	To solve, I have to reference one list with all users
	
3) IOException for reading objects with object input stream.
	It seems that there is no way for readObject to know how many bytes to read. Therefore, I had to catch the IOException to avoid
	reaching the EOF.
	- log this
	
4) Using one scanner, lists, serial objects all in the driver and reference them in the classes
	- only closing streams when program exits

5) customer>deposit
	- get index kept giving -1, so i had to create a loop to get the correct index of matching user
	
	
Things to try:
1) Login> create ...
	- Having separate method to write to file
	- It could be that a user object is being written to the file, not the actual implementation?
	
2) Have login.prompt() return an int for the driver
	- if user is verified, proceed to dashboard
	- may have to return a verified int for create ... also
	
3) constructors for all users

4) right now, i have users stored into a serial arraylist
	- after user submits changes to account dashboard, ill have to traverse the list and find the specific user
		who made the change. once user is found, add and save account information
		
5) Have main hold public serial objects as well as being responsible for creating the txt files
	
	
TODO
X) Remove print statements in SerializeUser
	- IOException
2) Remove print stmts in Login>create ...

3) fix Customer> apply
	- right now: multiple requests
